\section{New Results}

This thesis provides successor rules and implementations for enumerating the following languages: Ordered trees with a fixed number of nodes, Lukasiewicz words with fixed content, and Motzkin/Schroder words with fixed content. % and ordered trees with fixed branching sequence??
The algorithm for ordered trees is loopless and 
The algorithm for enumerating Lukasiewicz paths also provides a generalization of the cool-lex successor rule for multiset permutations, given in section 2. % TODO: reference here
