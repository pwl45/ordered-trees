% Two primary contributions, each with subcontributions
% each new result: one section on gray code, one section on implementation

% First background block
% MORE ABOUT LEXICOGRAPHIC ORDER - 1.1.1 lexicographic, 1.1.2 brgc. co lex, reverse lex, reverse co-lex
% address why not use lex order
% good to have different algorithms with different benefits
% like unsorting?
% parallels to sorting? this isn't

\chapter{Final Remarks}
The approach of “reflecting” sublists employed by the binary reflected Gray code is one of the most widely used approaches in combinatorial generation

modifications of cool-lex recursive structure?
Its recursive structure involves rotating sublists of co-lexicographic order.  
$\lshiftindex[\alpha]{i}{j}$ can also be thought of as rotating the $i$ through $j\thh$ symbols of $\alpha$ right circularly by one.

transform: as was discussed in intro, BRGC has many sublists that are also ray codes.  Beyond this, the idea of reversing sublists has been used in other gray codes that aren't BRGC. Eades mckay Divides strings into 3 cases. Result is homogenous transposition gray code, successive strings differ by transpositions where bits between transpositions are all zero. stronger closeness than sublist of BGRC. Similrly, one could move past sublists of cool-lex order into generalizing the recusive structure of the order. To understand this iddea, figure shows how co lex turns into cool lex.  more generally, other rotations.  In other words, one could look for orders that are cooler than cool. 
cool lex order for other cataln objects
triangulations, leave this to the reader?
