\section{Combinations: Fixed-Weight Binary Strings}
Generating all binary strings with $s$ zeroes and $t$ ones is often referred to as combinations, since each string can be used to represent a choice of $t$ elements from a set of size of $s+t$.  The cool-lex successor rule for generating all fixed-weight binary strings was given by Aaron Williams in his Ph. D thesis and is as follows \cite{williams2009shift}:

\noindent Let $S$ be a binary string of length $n$.

\noindent Let y be the position of the leftmost zero in S and x be the position of the leftmost 1 in S such that $x \ge y$.  Additionally, note that $S_1...S_{x-1}$ is the non-increasing prefix of S.

Let $\leftshift{S}{x}$ be a function that rotates the first i bits of a string S left circularly by one.

More formally, 
\noindent $\leftshift{S}{x}=S_2,S_3,...,S_i,S_1,S_{i-1},S_{i+1},S_{i+2},...,S_{2n}$
\begin{equation*}
    \overleftarrow{\text{cool}}(S) = \begin{cases}
	\leftshift{S}{x} & \text{if $S_{x+1}=1$}\\
	\leftshift{S}{x+1} & otherwise\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

Note that $S_1...S_{x-1}$ must be exactly $1^{y-1}0^{x-y}$, where exponentiation denotes repeated symbols.  Because of this, the two left-shift operations can be replaced with can be replaced with either one or two symbol transpositions.  

\noindent Let $\transpose{S}{i}{j}$ with $1 \le i \le j \le n$ be a function that swaps $S_i$ an $S_j$.  More formally, $\transpose{S}{i}{j}=S_1,S_2,\dots,S_{i-1},S_{j}S_{i+1}\dots S_{j-1}S_i S_{j+1}\dots S_n$
The left-shift rule can be re-stated as follows:

\begin{equation*}
    \overleftarrow{\text{cool}}(S) = \begin{cases}
	\transpose{S}{y}{x} & \text{if $S_{x+1}=1$}\\
	\transpose{\transpose{S}{y}{x}}{1}{x+1} & otherwise\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

% To illustrate the first case, consider $S=11001101$; note that x=5. $\leftshift{5}{1}=11100101$ can be accomplished by just setting $S_3=1$ and $S_5=0$, or alternatively $\transpose{S}{3}{5}$

% To illustrate the second case, consider $S=11100101$; note that x=6. $\leftshift{7}{1}=01110011$ with on  can be accomplished by setting $S_4=1$, $S_6=0$, $S_7=1$, and $S_1=0$.  

%Equivalently, the shift can be performed by $\transpose{\transpose{S}{4}{6}}{1}{7}$

% Thus, depending on the value of $S_{x+1}$, the cool-lex successor rule for binary strings requires either one or two transpositions per combination.  

\section{Cool Lex Order on Dyck Paths and Binary Trees}

Ruskey and Williams found the following successor rule for enumerating binary Dyck words, dubbed ``CoolCat" due to its use of a cool-lex order to generate (cat)alan objects \cite{ruskey2008generating}:
We will use $\mathbf{D}_n$ to denote binary Dyck words with $n$ ones and $n$ zeroes.  Note that the length of any string in $\mathbf{D}_n$ is thus $2n$.

\noindent Let $D \in \mathbf{D}_n$

\noindent Let the $i$th prefix shift of D, denoted by $\preshift{D}{i}$, be a function that rotates the second through ith symbols of D one to the right circularly.  More formally, 

\noindent $\preshift{d}{i}=d_1,d_i,d_2,...,d_{i-1},d_{i+1},d_{i+2},...,d_{2n}$


\noindent Let $k$ be the index of the 1 in the leftmost $01$ substring in $D$ if it exists. Note that if $D$ has no $01$ substring, then $D=1^n0^n$.  The successor rule for $D$ is as follows:


\begin{subnumcases}{\coolCat{D} = \label{eq:prefixDyck_simple}}
	\preshift{D}{2n} & \text{if $D$ has no $01$ substring}\\
	\preshift{D}{k+1} & if $\preshift{D}{k+1} \in \mathbf{D}_n$\\
	\preshift{D}{k} & otherwise
\end{subnumcases}

Ruskey and Williams's algorithm can also enumerate a broader set of strings: The algorithm enumerates any set $\mathbf{D}_{s,t}$ where any $D \in \mathbf{D}_{s,t}$ has s zeroes and t ones and satisfies the constraint that each prefix of D has as many ones as zeroes.  This is slightly broader than the language of Dyck words, as it does not have the requirement that a string have an equal number of ones and zeroes.
We will focus on $\mathbf{D}_n$  languages due to their correspondce with Dyck words and therefore other Catalan objects.

Evaluating whether $\preshift{D}{k+1} \in \mathbf{D}_n$ can be determined by looking $D_{k+1}$ and the sum of the first k symbols of D.  Specifically, 

% Let $D'=$ $\preshift{D}{k+1}$

% Note that we know $D \in \mathbf{D}_n$.  

% Since preshift only rotates symbols, $D'$ will automaticallly satisfy the requirement that strings in $\mathbf{D}_n$ must have an equal number of zeroes and ones since D satisfied that requirement. Thus, $D' \in \mathbf{D}_n$ will be determined by whether or not all prefixes of $D'$ have at least as many ones as zeroes.  

% If $D_{k+1}$ is a 1, then  for all i, the $i\thh$ prefix of $D'$ will have at least as many ones as the $i\thh$ prefix of D.  Thus, $D'$ must be $\in \mathbf{D}_n$, as rotating a 1 to earlier in the string will never invalidate the requirement that every prefix of the string has at least as many ones as zeroes.  

% Note that the $k\thh$ prefix of D must be of the form $1^a0^b1$, as otherwise there would be an earlier $01$ prefix.  Fruthermore, $a\ge b$ as otherwise the bth prefix of D would have more zeroes than ones and D would not be a valid Dyck word.

% If $D_{k+1}$ is a 0, then $D' \notin \mathbf{D}_n$ if and only if rotating a 0 to index 2 creates a prefix of D with more zeroes than ones.  This will only happen if the $(k-1)\thh$ prefix of D is exactly $1^{\frac{k-1}{2}}0^{\frac{k-1}{2}}$.  

% Therefore, $\preshift{D}{k+1} \in \mathbf{D}_n \iff D_{k+1}=1$ or $D$ starts with more than $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{2} \rfloor$ ones 

\begin{subnumcases}{\coolCat{D} = \label{eq:prefixDyck}}
    \preshift{D}{2n} & \text{if $D$ has no $01$ substring} \label{eq:prefixDyck_n}\\
	\preshift{D}{k+1} & $D_{k+1}=1$ or $D$ starts with more than $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{2} \rfloor$ ones \label{eq:prefixDyck_k1}\\
	\preshift{D}{k} & otherwise \label{eq:prefixDyck_k}
\end{subnumcases}

Since $k$ is the index of the first $01$ substring in D, $\sum_{i=1}^{k}S_i$ is actually just the number of consecutive ones to start D, which simplifies the evaluation of this conditional even further: 

$\preshift{D}{k+1} \in \mathbf{D}_{n} \iff$ $D$ starts with more than $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{2} \rfloor$ ones

Ruskey and Williams provided a loopless pseudocode implementation of CoolCat that utilized this fact to enumerate any $\mathbf{D}_{s,t}$ using at most 2 conditionals per successor \cite{ruskey2008generating}. In accordance with the bijection between Dyck words and binary trres, Ruskey and Williams also showed that their successor rule can be translated to a loopless algorithm for generating all binary trees with $n$ nodes. That algorithm is as follows:

% TODO: binary trees algorithm

Due to its simplicity and efficienty, Don Knuth included the cool-lex algorithm for Dyck words in his 4th volume of \emph{The Art of Computer Programming} and also provided an implementation of it for his theoretical MMIX processor architecture \cite{knuth2015art}.

\section{Multiset Permutations}

Cool-lex order has also been shown to enumerate multiset permutations via prefix shifts.  The rule given by Williams is as follows \cite{williams2009loopless}:
\bigskip

\noindent Let S be a multiset of length n.

\noindent Let i be the maximum value such that $S_{j-1} \ge s_j$ for all $2 \le j \le i$.  In other words, i is the length of the non-increasing prefix of S.  

\noindent Let $\sigma_j(S)$ be a function that shifts the ith value of S into the first position, or equivalently rotates the first i elements of S right circularly.  More formally, 

\noindent $\sigma_j(S)=S_j,S_1,S_1,\dots,S_{j-1},S_j+1,\dots,S_n $

Then

\begin{equation*}
    \text{nextPerm}(S) = \begin{cases}
	\sigma_{i+1}(S) & \text{if $i \le n-2$ and $s_{i+2} > s_i$}\\
	\sigma_{i+2}(S) & \text{if $i \le n-2$ and $s_{i+2} \le s_i$}\\
	\sigma_{n}(S) & otherwise\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}


See Fig. \ref{fig:permutations} for an example comparison of cool-lex and lexicographic order for two multisets.

This successor rule has the nice property of ensuring that length of the successor's non-increasing prefix is easy to find.

In particular, if $S_{i+2}$ is shifted, then the length of the non-increasing prefix is either 1 if $S_{i+2}\le S_1$ or $i+1$ otherwise. 

Similarly, if $S_{i+1}$ is shifted, then the length of the non-increasing prefix is either 1 if $S_{i+1}\le S_1$ or $i+1$ otherwise. 

This allows for a loopless implementation of the successor rule, as scanning the string to find the length of the non-increasing prefix is not required.  Due to the simplicity and efficiency of this rule, it is used in the ``multicool" package in R, which is used for generating multiset permutations, Bell numbers, and other combinatorial objects \cite{multicool_2021}.
