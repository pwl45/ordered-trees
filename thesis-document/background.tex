\subsection{Dyck Words}
The language of binary Dyck words is the set of sequences of binary digits that satisfy the following conditions: The sequence has an equal number of ones and zeroes and there is no prefix of the sequence in which the number of zeroes exceeds the number of ones.  The Dyck language can equivalently be thought of as the set of balanced parentheses, with ones representing open parentheses and zeroes representing closing parentheses.  
In addition to balanced parentheses, Dyck words of length $2n$ are also in bijective correspondence with extended binary trees with $n$ internal nodes. 
Given an extended binary tree $B$ with n internal nodes, a Dyck word can be obtained by traversing B in preorder and recording each internal node as a $1$ and each leaf with a $0$, ignoring the final leaf of the tree.
